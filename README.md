# Forecasting-Production-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks

This repository contains an implmentation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for forecasting  oil, gas, and water production using historical data from [Equinor's Volve Field dataset](https://www.equinor.com/energy/volve-data-sharing).
